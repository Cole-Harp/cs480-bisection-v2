# Bisect Project Repository

Welcome to the Bisect Exercise!

You will use `git bisect` to determine exactly where an error was introduced into this Git repository.

1. Checkout your group's branch: `git checkout group[n]`
2. Try running the `program.py` program. It should fail letting you know that a file has an error.
3. Your task is now to find out exactly which commit introduced this error, and which Git user introduced it. Use the `git bisect` command to do this. 

Have fun!
